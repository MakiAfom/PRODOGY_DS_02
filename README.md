This is  a repo on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
 The Steps that I follow to Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 Steps for Data Cleaning and EDA:
1)Data Loading: I Begin by loading the dataset into my preferred data analysis environment, such as Python (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn) or R.

2)Understanding the Data:
View basic information about the dataset: number of rows and columns, data types, missing values, etc.
I Use methods like info(), describe(), head(), tail(), and shape to gain initial insights.

3)Handling Missing Values:

To Identify missing data in the dataset (isnull() or isna() in Pandas).
strategies to handle missing values: dropping columns/rows, imputation, etc., based on the significance of missing data.

4)Data Cleaning:

Clean and preprocess the dataset:
Standardize column names.
Convert data types if necessary (e.g., converting categorical variables to appropriate data types).
Remove duplicates.
Address outliers if relevant.



5)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distribution using histograms, box plots, etc.
Analyze correlations between variables (e.g., correlation matrix, scatter plots).
Explore categorical variables using bar plots, count plots, etc.
Identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
Grouping and aggregating data for further insights.
Feature Engineering:

6)Create new features if required, based on existing data.
Statistical Analysis:

Perform statistical tests or calculations if necessary (e.g., hypothesis testing, summary statistics).
Summarize Findings:

Document my observations, insights, and any actionable findings.
I Create visualizations or summary tables to present key findings.
Conclusion:

Conclude the analysis with key takeaways, limitations, and potential next steps for further analysis or modeling.
